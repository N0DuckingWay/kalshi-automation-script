Purpose:
    Central store for all tunable constants, file paths, and fee-formula helpers
    used throughout the kalshi_betting package. Every threshold that controls
    whether a pair is traded, how large a position is, or how fees are estimated
    lives here so they can be adjusted without touching business logic in other
    modules. Both the live trading pipeline (main.py) and the backtest pipeline
    (backtest.py, backtester.py) import from this file.

Dependencies:
    No project imports. Imported by auth.py, scanner.py, strategy.py, trader.py,
    reporter.py, historical.py, backtester.py, dashboard.py, backtest.py,
    scheduler.py, and main.py.

Notes:
    PROJECT_ROOT is derived from __file__ so the package works correctly on any
    machine regardless of where the repo is cloned.
    The sandbox URL (demo-api.kalshi.co) requires a completely separate account
    registered at demo.kalshi.co — the production API key will return 401 there.

    Compute a continuous approximation of the total Kalshi taker fee for one pair trade.

    Used during pair filtering and Kelly sizing (before the exact integer contract
    count is known). The exact fee formula uses ceiling rounding per leg; this
    approximation treats the contract count as a continuous quantity, making it
    suitable for threshold comparisons.

    The formula is: TAKER_FEE_RATE * (nA*(1-nA) + pB*(1-pB)), which sums the
    quadratic fee contribution from the NO leg (market A) and the YES leg (market B).

    Args:
        nA (float): NO ask price of market A in dollars. Range: (0, 1).

            fee_leg_exact() so an underestimated fee cannot admit a bad trade.
